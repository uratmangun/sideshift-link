## 1. Create an Account

1. A SideShift.ai account is automatically created in two ways:

   - When creating a shift on the site
   - When visiting the [account page](https://sideshift.ai/account)

2. Copy your **Private Key** – used as `x-sideshift-secret`.
   :::warning
   Never share your Private Key with anyone. It grants full access to your account and should be kept secret.
   :::

3. Copy your **Account ID** – passed as `affiliateId`.

```bash title=".env"
SIDESHIFT_SECRET=YOUR_ACCOUNT_SECRET #REPLACE WITH YOUR SIDESHIFT ACCOUNT SECRET
AFFILIATE_ID=YQMi62XMb #REPLACE WITH YOUR SIDESHIFT ACCOUNT ID
```

## 2. Request a Quote

```
curl -L 'https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/quotes' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-sideshift-secret: $SIDESHIFT_SECRET' \
-d '{
  "depositCoin": "eth",
  "depositNetwork": "arbitrum",
  "settleCoin": "eth",
  "settleNetwork": "mainnet",
  "depositAmount": "0.14364577",
  "settleAmount": null,
  "affiliateId": "$AFFILIATE_ID"
}'
```

Save the returned `id` as `QUOTE_ID`.

## 3. Create a Fixed Shift

```
curl -L 'https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/shifts/fixed' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-sideshift-secret: $SIDESHIFT_SECRET' \
-d '{
  "settleAddress": "0xde2642b2120fd3011fe9659688f76e9E4676F472",
  "affiliateId": "$AFFILIATE_ID",
  "quoteId": "QUOTE_ID"
}'
```

Display the `depositAddress` to your user and poll `/v2/shifts/{shiftId}` to monitor the shift's status.

# Monetization

:::info
Integrators earn a default 0.5% commission on all shifts, configurable from 0% to 2% using the `commissionRate` parameter. Users of integrations shift at competitive rates; the commission is included in the exchange rate, not added on top.
:::

## Setup Requirements

To receive commissions, you must include your `Account ID` as the `affiliateId` in all shift creation requests. SideShift.ai uses this to track and attribute shifts to your integration.

## Commission Rate Examples

:::note
**Website rate** : `1 USDC → 0.981 USDT` (includes default 0.5% commission)

*Example figures for illustration only. Live quotes vary.*
:::

| `commissionRate` | Relative to website | Example user rate        |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| `0%`             | **0.5% better**     | `1 USDC → 0.986 USDT`     |
| `0.5%`           | **same**            | `1 USDC → 0.981 USDT`     |
| `1%`             | **0.5% worse**      | `1 USDC → 0.976 USDT`     |
| `2%`             | **1.5% worse**      | `1 USDC → 0.966 USDT`     |

## Commission Payouts

- **Automatic payouts**: Available once you configure your payout settings

# Permissions

SideShift.ai is not available in certain jurisdictions. Learn [more](https://help.sideshift.ai/en/articles/2874595-why-am-i-blocked-from-using-sideshift-ai).

Integrators are advised to use the [`/v2/permissions`](/endpoints/v2/permissions) endpoint to determine if the user is allowed to use SideShift.ai.

### Proxying User Requests

SideShift.ai does not allow proxying user requests. This means that the user should either directly interact with the SideShift.ai REST API, or if the API requests are sent from the integration's own server, the `x-user-ip` header must be set to the end-user's IP address.

### The x-user-ip Header

The `x-user-ip` header helps SideShift.ai identify the original source of the request, which is important for security reasons and ensuring that the service is not being used by users in restricted countries. It’s crucial that this header is set correctly by integrations to prevent any issues with using the API.

# Shift

To trade with SideShift.ai, users must first create a shift. A shift can be of type fixed or variable rate.

### Fixed rate

- These shifts lock in the exchange rate for 15 minutes, including all fees. The rate is secured once the quote is created using the [`/v2/quotes`](/endpoints/v2/requestquote) endpoint. After 15 minutes, the quote and the shift expire, and any deposit made to the shift is refunded. To create a fixed-rate shift, first request a quote, then create the shift via the [`/v2/shifts/fixed`](/endpoints/v2/createfixedshift) endpoint.

![Fixed Rate Flow](/img/fixed-rate-flow.svg)

### Variable rate

- These shifts don’t lock in the rate until the user makes a deposit, at which point network fees are included in the rate calculation. They remain valid for seven days and can be requested in one step using the [`/v2/shifts/variable`](/endpoints/v2/createvariableshift) endpoint.

![Variable Rate Flow](/img/variable-rate-flow.svg)

:::tip

For integrations that allow their users to input an amount before creating either a fixed or variable rate shift, the [`/v2/pair`](/endpoints/v2/pair) endpoint can be used to accurately estimate the impact of [network fees](/api-intro/network-fees) on the rate for the specified pair. This can be done by setting the input amount as the optional `amount` query parameter.

When integrations are unaware of the exact amount their users will send for a variable rate shift, they can choose to present on their application either:

- `settleCoinNetworkFee`, denominated in `settle coin`
- `networkFeeUsd`, denominated in `USD`

Both represent the estimated sum of network fees that will be charged for the shift.

:::

# Deposits

A deposit is a transaction a user makes to a shift to receive the equivalent amount in the coin they select.

## Minimum and Maximum Deposit Range

The Minimum Deposit Range has a default value of 3 USD and is determined after incorporating the network fees. The Maximum Deposit Range is always set by SideShift.ai and varies from coin to coin.

For more detailed information to help if the amount sent is outside the deposit range, please check out:

- [Under-Minimum Shift Deposit](https://help.sideshift.ai/en/articles/3735849-i-sent-below-the-minimum-amount-for-my-shift-what-can-i-do)
- [Over-Maximum Shift Deposit](https://help.sideshift.ai/en/articles/3825201-i-sent-over-the-maximum-amount-for-my-shift-what-can-i-do)

## Determining the Minimum Deposit Range

Here’s how to calculate the `Minimum Deposit Range`, assuming the network fee is 20 USD:

```
Minimum Deposit = (1 / 0.2) * network fee
Minimum Deposit = (1 / 0.2) * 20
Minimum Deposit = 100
```

In this scenario, we compare the calculated value of 100 USD to the default minimum deposit, assuming a default minimum deposit of 3 USD, to determine the `Minimum Deposit Range`. The `Minimum Deposit Range` is the higher of these two values, which in this case is 100 USD.

## Handling Multiple Deposits

### Fixed Shifts

Only the first valid deposit is settled. Any additional deposits that are received after the first deposit are refunded to the user.

### Variable Shifts

The shift can receive and process multiple deposits individually. Deposits are not merged; each one is handled based on its own specific conditions and the prevailing market rates at the time of processing.

:::note
It is not desirable for users to make multiple deposits to the same shift, and integrators should avoid encouraging this behavior.
:::

## Deposits within EVM networks

For supported EVM networks, SideShift.ai uses a deposit address, which is a smart contract for tokens, for each created shift. When a balance is detected on this contract, the system performs a sweep operation. This operation sends the funds from the deposit address to SideShift.ai's main address. The sweeper transaction is then detected as a "deposit".

:::note
For EVM networks, TRON, Aptos, Sui, NEAR, and Algorand, the `depositHash` returned in the API represents the sweep transaction hash.
:::

Occasionally, this sweeper transaction isn't broadcasted to the network, which triggers another attempt to sweep the funds from the deposit address. In this case, another deposit is created with `pending` status that will be processed, while the first deposit remains in `pending` status.

## Deposit Issues

Sometimes deposits will not be automatically processed for various reasons as summarized in the table below. The `issue` field will have a value when `status` is `review` or `refund`. If `status` is `multiple` and one of the deposits are in `review` or `refund` status, this deposit object will have an `issue` field.

| Issue                | Remarks                                                                                        | Resolution                             |

| `amount under min`   | User sent below the minimum amount.                                                            | Processed or refund after human review |
| `refund required`    | The shift will be refunded after a refund address is provided                                  | Refund after an address is provided    |
| `incorrect amount`   | User sent the incorrect amount for a fixed rate shift.                                         | Processed or refund after human review |
| `order expired`      | The shift has already expired when SideShift.ai detected the deposit                           | Processed or refund after human review |
| `max 1 deposit`      | Fixed rate shifts can have maximum one deposit                                                 | Refund after an address is provided    |
| `too many deposits`  | More than 5 deposits have been made to a variable rate shift                                   | Refund after an address is provided    |
| `review`             | Shift is under human review and will be processed or refunded                                  | Processed or refund after human review |
| `coin unavailable`   | Either the deposit or settle method is currently not available for shifts.                     | Refund after human review              |
| `rate drift`         | The rate changed too much between the time the quote was created and the deposit was detected. | Processed or refund after human review |
| `duplicate`          | The deposit is a duplicate of another deposit.                                                 | Refund after human review              |
| `low effective rate` | The effective rate is too low as the network fees would consume too high % of the shift value  | Refund after an address is provided    |

## Deposit Rejection Rules

#### Below Minimum Rejection

`Applies to:` Variable rate shifts

`Rule:` Deposits below the minimum amount might be settled if the coin for settlement has low network fees. If the network fees are high (e.g., BTC), the deposit will remain rejected.

#### Incorrect Amount Rejection

`Applies to:` Fixed rate shifts

`Rule:` Deposits with an incorrect amount will be auto-refunded if the coin for refund has low network fees and the refund address has been set. Otherwise, the refund address will be requested. If the network fees are high, the deposit will remain rejected for review. Incorrect amount deposits with a slightly different value might be settled.

# Refunds

SideShift.ai may have to refund the user’s deposit for multiple reasons mentioned in [Deposit Issues](/api-intro/deposits#deposit-issues).

Refunds are processed automatically if a `refundAddress` is set when creating shifts. This applies to both fixed rate shifts via the [`/v2/shifts/fixed`](/endpoints/v2/createfixedshift) endpoint and variable rate shifts via the [`/v2/shifts/variable`](/endpoints/v2/createvariableshift) endpoint.

For coins that require a memo, the `refundMemo` is optional but can be included.

If a `refundAddress` is not initially provided, it can be set using the [`/v2/shifts/shiftId/set-refund-address`](/endpoints/v2/setrefundaddress) endpoint or users can enter it manually at https://sideshift.ai/orders/{shiftId}. Additionally, this endpoint can be utilized by integrations to prompt users to set the refund address on their respective websites or apps.

:::tip

Replace `{shiftId}` with the actual shiftId, e.g., ed06bbaccdbade5feca7.

:::

# Terminology

**deposit**\[Amount\]\[Address\]\[Memo\]\[Coin\]\[Network\]\[Tx\]: Refers to data about the coin the user is shifting **from**. For example, in a shift from BTC to ETH:

- `depositCoin`: the ticker of the coin the user needs to send to SideShift.ai, e.g. `btc`
- `depositNetwork`: the id of the `depositCoin` network, e.g. `bitcoin` or `mainnet`
- `depositAmount`: the amount of BTC the user needs to deposit
- `depositAddress`: the address the user needs to send the BTC to
- `depositMemo`: The memo that the user needs to include when sending to the deposit address for some coins, e.g., XRP, XLM, ATOM, and KAVA

**settle**\[Amount\]\[Address\]\[Memo\]\[Coin\]\[Network\]\[Rate\]\[Tx\]: Refers to data about the coin the user is shifting **to**. For example:

- `settleCoin`: the ticker of the coin SideShift.ai will send the user, e.g. `eth`
- `settleNetwork`: the ID of the network of the `settleCoin`, e.g. `ethereum` or `optimism`
- `settleAmount`: the amount of ETH SideShift.ai will send
- `settleRate`: the rate at which the coins are exchanged. For example, if a user sends 0.1 BTC and receives 1 ETH, the `settleRate` is 10
- `settleAddress`: The address SideShift.ai will send the ETH to
- `settleTx`: details of the transaction SideShift.ai sent to the user
- `settleMemo`: SideShift supports sending coins to addresses that require a memo on some chains, such as XRP, XLM, ATOM, KAVA, and ALGO

See the [`/v2/coins`](/endpoints/v2/coins) endpoint for a full list of coins and their respective networks supported by SideShift.ai.

# Shift Integration Guide

## Integrating Fixed and Variable Shifts

### Best Practices

1. Set up environment variables for sensitive data:

   ```env
   SIDESHIFT_SECRET=your_account_private_key
   AFFILIATE_ID=your_affiliate_id
   API_BASE_URL=https://sideshift.ai/api/v2
   ```

   :::warning
   Never share your Private Key with anyone. It grants full access to your account and should be kept secret.
   :::

2. Error handling and monitoring:
   - Implement a logging system
   - Monitor API response times
   - Track failed requests

### Fixed Shift

**Request a Quote:** The first step is to request a quote using the [`/v2/quotes`](/endpoints/v2/requestquote) endpoint. This will provide you with a `quoteId` that you will use in the next step. Always include the `x-sideshift-secret` header, and if the request originates from the integration's server, the end user’s IP address should be forwarded in the `x-user-ip` header.

```bash title="Example of a quote request"
curl -L -X POST 'https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/quotes' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-sideshift-secret: ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY' \
-H 'x-user-ip: END_USER_IP_ADDRESS' \
--data-raw '{
    "affiliateId": "ACCOUNT_AFFILIATE_ID",
    "depositCoin": "BTC",
    "depositNetwork": "bitcoin",
    "settleCoin": "ETH",
    "settleNetwork": "ethereum",
    "depositAmount": "0.01"
}'
```

**Implementation notes:**

- Store the returned `quoteId`
- Implement quote expiration handling
- Add error handling for network issues

**Create a Fixed Shift**: After obtaining the `quoteId`, you can create a fixed rate shift using the [`/v2/shifts/fixed`](/endpoints/v2/createfixedshift) endpoint. The `affiliateId` used in this step must match the one used to request the quote.

```bash title="Example of creating a fixed shift"
curl -L -X POST 'https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/shifts/fixed' \
-H 'x-sideshift-secret: ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY' \
-H 'x-user-ip: END_USER_IP_ADDRESS' \
--data-raw '{
    "settleAddress": "SETTLE_ADDRESS",
    "affiliateId": "ACCOUNT_AFFILIATE_ID",
    "quoteId": "QUOTE_ID"
}'
```

**Implementation notes:**

- Validate quote hasn't expired
- Implement proper error handling
- Start status monitoring after creation

### Variable Shift

**Create a Variable Shift:** To create a variable shift, use the [`/v2/shifts/variable`](/endpoints/v2/createvariableshift) endpoint with the required parameters. Always include the `x-sideshift-secret` header, and if the request originates from the integration's server, the end user’s IP address should be forwarded in the `x-user-ip` header.

```bash title="Example of creating a variable shift"
curl -L -X POST 'https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/shifts/variable' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-sideshift-secret: ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY' \
-H 'x-user-ip: END_USER_IP_ADDRESS' \
--data-raw '{
    "settleAddress": "SETTLE_ADDRESS",
    "affiliateId": "ACCOUNT_AFFILIATE_ID",
    "depositCoin": "BTC",
    "depositNetwork": "bitcoin",
    "settleCoin": "ETH",
    "settleNetwork": "ethereum",
}'
```

**Implementation notes:**

- Display min/max deposit ranges
- Show real-time rate updates
- Implement proper error handling
- Start status monitoring

**Monitor Status:**

- Poll the shift status every few seconds using the [`/v2/shifts/{shiftId}`](/endpoints/v2/shift) endpoint
- Handle all possible status states
- Implement proper UI feedback for each status

## Key Integration Guidelines:

### User Permissions

The [`/v2/permissions`](/endpoints/v2/permissions) endpoint can be used to determine if the user is allowed to use SideShift.ai. This endpoint can be called before any shift creation.

### Deposit

For fixed rate shifts, a deposit of exactly the amount of `depositAmount` must be made before the `expiresAt` timestamp, otherwise the deposit will be refunded. For variable rate shifts, the user can send any amount within the minimum and maximum deposit ranges. The exchange rate will be determined when the user's deposit is received.

### Set Refund Address (Optional)

`refundAddress` and `refundMemo` are optional. If they aren’t defined, the user will be prompted to enter a refund address manually on the SideShift.ai order page if the shift needs to be refunded. Alternatively, the [`/v2/shifts/{shiftId}/set-refund-address`](/endpoints/v2/setrefundaddress) endpoint can be used to set the refund address if the shift has a `refund` status.

### Handle Memos (Optional)

For shifts that return a `depositMemo`, the deposit transaction must include this memo; otherwise, the deposit might be lost. For shifts settling in coins where the network is included in the `networksWithMemo` array in the [`/v2/coins`](/endpoints/v2/coins) endpoint, integrations can specify a `settleMemo` field.

### Receive Settlement

Once the deposit is confirmed in the blockchain, SideShift.ai will process the shift and send the settled amount to the `settleAddress`.

# Receiving support

In case something goes wrong with the user's shift, they can receive support from SideShift.ai through the following methods:

1. **Email Support:** Users can send an email to [help@sideshift.ai](mailto:help@sideshift.ai) to receive support. To ensure a faster resolution, users should include their shift ID in the support email. The shift ID is returned when creating a shift using the [`/v2/shifts/fixed`](/endpoints/v2/createfixedshift) or [`/v2/shifts/variable`](/endpoints/v2/createvariableshift) endpoint. It's recommended for integrations to pre-populate the email template with the user's shift ID.
2. **Support Chat:** Users can access support by clicking on the chat icon at SideShift.ai and providing their shift ID. Similarly, integrations can leverage the SideShift.ai support chat to offer a seamless support experience to their users. It's recommended for integrations to include a link directing users to the SideShift.ai support chat. To initiate a support chat session with a pre-filled shift ID, integrations can use the following as reference: [https://sideshift.ai/orders/4c3839c16640704410b0?openSupport=true](https://sideshift.ai/orders/4c3839c16640704410b0?openSupport=true)

# Endpoints

## V2 vs V1 API

SideShift.ai strongly advises integrators to use the new V2 API version. It handles multi-network coins much more efficiently and uses easier to understand terminology. V1 API is deprecated and will not be developed further. The documentation for V1 will remain here to support already existing integrations, who are also strongly encouraged to make the switch to V2.

# Coins

Returns the list of coins and their respective networks available on SideShift.ai.

The fields `fixedOnly`, `variableOnly`, `depositOffline`, `settleOffline` will return `false` if `false` for every network. `true` for single network assets and an array of networks for mixed.

# Pair

<h1 className={"openapi__heading"}>Pair</h1>

Returns the minimum and maximum deposit amount and the rate for a pair of coins.

`from` and `to` can be `coin-network` or if `network` is omitted, it will default to the `mainnet`. E.g `eth-ethereum`, `eth-mainnet` or `eth` all refer to ETH on the Ethereum network. `eth-arbitrum` refers to ETH on Arbitrum network.

The rate is determined after incorporating network fees. Without specifying an `amount`, the system will assume a deposit value of `500 USD`. This can be adjusted by adding the `amount` query parameter.

Without specifying the amount at the endpoint, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate X = ( default deposit amount - (USDT receiving fee + BTC sending fee) / default deposit amount) / BTC price
Rate X = 0.000032333333333
```

```
/pair/usdt-eth/btc?amount=10000

With a specified amount at the endpoint, such as 10000, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate Y = ( specified amount - (USDT receiving fee + BTC sending fee) / specified amount) / BTC price
Rate Y = 0.000033283333333

With a specified amount of 10000, the rate is higher. This is because the 15 USD combined network fee has a reduced impact on larger shifts, making it less significant in the overall cost of the 500 USD shift.

# Shift

<h1 className={"openapi__heading"}>Shift</h1>

Returns the shift data for single shift. For bulk retrieval, use [`/v2/shifts?ids=shiftId1,shiftId2`](/endpoints/v2/bulkshifts).

For shift that has `multiple` as status, the `deposits` array in the API response holds all deposits associated with a shift.

- **Fixed Shifts**: The array will show multiple deposits, but only the first deposit is settled. Subsequent deposits are refunded.
- **Variable Shifts**: Multiple deposits are listed and processed individually according to the current market rates and conditions.

:::note
It is not desirable for users to make multiple deposits to the same shift, and integrators should avoid encouraging this behavior.

# Request quote

<h1 className={"openapi__heading"}>Request quote</h1>

For fixed rate shifts, a quote should be requested first.

A quote can be requested for either a `depositAmount` or a `settleAmount`.

When defining non-native tokens like AXS and USDT for `depositCoin` and/or `settleCoin`, the `depositNetwork` and `settleNetwork` fields must also be specified. This also applies to native tokens like ETH that supports multiple networks.

`commissionRate` optional parameter can be used to adjust rates for your users. The default commission rate is 0.5%. Rates below the default offer better rates by reducing affiliate commission, while rates above the default are passed on to the user. The maximum commission rate is 2%.

:::info
Use the same `commissionRate` in the `/v2/pair` and `/v2/pairs` endpoints as when creating the shift/quotes to get an accurate rate information. See [Monetization](/api-intro/monetization) for detailed examples of how commission rates affect rates.
:::

If the API requests are sent from the integration’s own server, the `x-user-ip` header must be set to the end-user IP address; otherwise, the requests will be blocked. See [Permissions](/api-intro/permissions).

After the quote request, a fixed rate shift should be created using the \`id\` returned by the `/v2/quotes` endpoint.

A quote expires after **15 minutes**.

:::warning
`x-sideshift-secret` is your account's private key. Never share it with anyone as it grants full access to your account and should be kept confidential.

# Create fixed shift

<h1 className={"openapi__heading"}>Create fixed shift</h1>

After requesting a quote, use the `quoteId` to create a fixed rate shift with the quote. The `affiliateId` must match the one used to request the quote.

For fixed rate shifts, a deposit of exactly the amount of `depositAmount` must be made before the `expiresAt` timestamp, otherwise the deposit will be refunded.

For shifts that return a `depositMemo`, the deposit transaction must include this memo, otherwise the deposit might be lost.

For shifts settling in coins where the network is included in the `networksWithMemo` array in the [`/v2/coins`](/endpoints/v2/coins) endpoint, API users are allowed to specify a `settleMemo` field, for example `"settleMemo": "123343245"`.

`x-sideshift-secret` header is required. It can be obtained from the [account page](https://sideshift.ai/account) under the account secret.

:::warning
`x-sideshift-secret` is your account's private key. Never share it with anyone as it grants full access to your account and should be kept confidential.
:::

`refundAddress` and `refundMemo` are optional. If they aren't defined, the user is prompted to enter a refund address manually on the SideShift.ai order page if the shift needs to be refunded.

If the API requests are sent from the integration's own server, the `x-user-ip` header must be set to the end-user IP address; otherwise, the requests will be blocked. See [Permissions](/api-intro/permissions).

`averageShiftSeconds` represents the average time in seconds it takes for SideShift to process a shift once the user's deposit is **confirmed** on the blockchain.

`externalId` is an optional field that can be used to pass an integration's own ID to the API.

# Create variable shift

<h1 className={"openapi__heading"}>Create variable shift</h1>

For variable rate shifts, the settlement rate is determined when the user's deposit is received.

For shifts that return a `depositMemo`, the deposit transaction must include this memo, otherwise the deposit might be lost.

For shifts settling in coins where the network is included in the `networksWithMemo` array in the [`/v2/coins`](/endpoints/v2/coins), integrations can specify a `settleMemo` field, for example `"settleMemo": "123343245"`.

When defining non-native tokens like AXS and USDT for `depositCoin` and/or `settleCoin`, the `depositNetwork` and `settleNetwork` fields must also be specified. This also applies to native tokens like ETH that supports multiple networks.

`x-sideshift-secret` header is required. It can be obtained from the [account page](https://sideshift.ai/account) under the account secret.

:::warning
`x-sideshift-secret` is your account's private key. Never share it with anyone as it grants full access to your account and should be kept confidential.
:::

`refundAddress` and `refundMemo`are optional, if not defined, user will be prompted to enter a refund address manually on the SideShift.ai order page if the shift needs to be refunded.

`commissionRate` optional parameter can be used to adjust rates for your users. The default commission rate is 0.5%. Rates below the default offer better rates by reducing affiliate commission, while rates above the default are passed on to the user. The maximum commission rate is 2%.

:::info
Use the same `commissionRate` in the `/v2/pair` and `/v2/pairs` endpoints as when creating the shift/quotes to get an accurate rate information. See [Monetization](/api-intro/monetization) for detailed examples of how commission rates affect rates.
:::

If the API requests are sent from the integration’s own server, the `x-user-ip` header must be set to the end-user IP address; otherwise, the requests will be blocked. See [Permissions](/api-intro/permissions).

`averageShiftSeconds` represents the average time in seconds it takes for SideShift to process a shift once the user’s deposit is **confirmed** on the blockchain.

`settleCoinNetworkFee` represents the estimated sum of [network fees](/api-intro/network-fees) charged for the shift denominated in settle coin.

`networkFeeUsd` represents the estimated sum of [network fees](/api-intro/network-fees) charged for the shift denominated in USD.

`externalId` is an optional field that can be used to pass an integration's own ID to the API.

| How should fixed rate shifts be used compared to variable shifts?                                                                 | We recommend using fixed rate only when users cannot change the amount they send and for when the `settleAmount` must be exact. In situations where there is flexibility, and to reduce errors where users might send the wrong amount, we recommend opting for variable rate shifts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| What's the recommended integration, fixed or variable shifts?                                                                     | Fixed rate shifts are the preferred option when you need users to specify the amount they send or receive before creating a shift via the API. Fixed rate shifts expire in 15 minutes, while variable rate ones expire in 7 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Would the exchange fail if we don't send the expected amount in a fixed rate conversion?                                          | Yes, if you don’t send the exact expected amount to a fixed order, it will need to be refunded. We recommend that you set the refund address when creating a new shift just in case the deposit needs to be refunded. Wallet app integrations are advised to set the refund address to the address the users are sending the deposit coin from as this makes the refund process much smoother.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| What are the minimum and maximum deposit ranges?                                                                                  | The minimum deposit range has a default value and is determined after incorporating network fees while the maximum deposit range is set by SideShift.ai and varies from coin to coin. Both ranges are denominated in USD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| How do I handle coins or tokens with memos?                                                                                       | For shifts that return a `depositMemo`, the deposit transaction must include this memo, otherwise, the deposit might be lost. For shifts settling in coins where the network is included in the `networksWithMemo` array in the [`/v2/coins`](/endpoints/v2/coins) endpoint, API users are allowed to specify a `settleMemo` field. Additionally, shifts can include optional `refundAddress` and `refundMemo`, if not defined, the user will be prompted to enter a refund address manually on the SideShift.ai order page if the shift needs to be refunded.                           |
| How do I know if a coin or token is not available in other supported networks for either depositCoin or settleCoin?               | The API will return an array of networks for `depositOffline`, `settleOffline`, `fixedOnly`, `variableOnly`. So, for example, if ethereum is currently offline for deposit and settle, the response will include `ethereum` in the `depositOffline` and `settleOffline` arrays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| If a user chooses the wrong network, do you offer refunds? If so, what are the conditions for a refund?                           | We will recover and refund the user for any incorrect coin and/or network deposit that we have access to the address on the network user sent. This is usually done without any fee and within 3 days. If the network fees to recover are more than the deposit value, we will not recover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| What happens if an amount is sent outside of the range or after the shift expires?                                                | In both cases, shifts might be processed or refunded after human review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| What flow is recommended if users use a fixed rate shift and pay the incorrect balance and how will they manage to retrieve them? | For fixed orders, we recommend that integrations pre-populate the amount field in their application’s UI and prevent users from changing it. We also recommend defining the `refundAddress` in the create order request so refunds can happen automatically if anything goes wrong. Wallet app integrations should set the refund address to the address the user is sending from to make the refund process smoother.                                                                                                                                                                   |

# SideShift Widget

To embed the SideShift widget, start with the [Embed Generator Form](https://sideshift.ai/embed) for a code snippet to add to your website's `<head>` section. The Embed Tool allows users with minimal coding experience to integrate SideShift.ai. Use it to process payments, as an exchange widget, and more. The possibilities are endless.

:::tip

Use your SideShift.ai account's affiliate ID for the `parentAffiliateId` field. Learn more about _[Monetization](/api-intro/monetization)_.
:::

## Example Embed Code

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.__SIDESHIFT__ = {
    parentAffiliateId: "k0Kx8oXzy",
    defaultDepositMethodId: "btc",
    defaultSettleMethodId: "eth",
    settleAddress: undefined,
    type: "variable",
    commissionRate: "0.01",
    settleAmount: undefined,
    theme: "dark",
  };
</script>
<script src="https://sideshift.ai/static/js/main.js"></script>
```

Following this setup, you have two main options:

## Option 1: Open Using the SideShift Button

Place the SideShift Button anywhere on your website. When users click on it, the embedded SideShift Widget will appear as a full-screen overlay. [See demo here](https://jsfiddle.net/sideshift_ai/kvqtf2wu/).

```html title="Copy and paste this anywhere in your HTML"
<style scoped>
  #sideshift-modal-button {
    -webkit-appearance: none;
    color: rgb(17, 11, 11);
    background-color: rgb(232, 90, 67);
    transition: all 150ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
    text-decoration: none;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-size: 1rem;
    line-height: 1.5rem;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0.875rem 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 3rem;
    min-width: 13rem;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  #sideshift-modal-button:hover {
    opacity: 0.9;
  }
</style>

<button onClick="window.sideshift.show()" id="sideshift-modal-button">
  Shift Crypto
</button>
```

## Option 2: Open Programmatically

Below is the documentation on how to use the Embed plugin. Utilize the embed plugin code to open the widget through your own custom triggers or user interaction flows.

```js
/**
 * Sideshift plugin library
 */
const sideshift = window.sideshift;

/**
 * Show plugin
 */
sideshift.show();

/**
 * Hide plugin
 */
sideshift.hide();

/**
 * Listen for settled event
 * (happens when a shift has been settled with at least one deposit)
 */
sideshift.addEventListener("settled", (deposits) => {
  console.log(deposits);
  // deposits = [{

  //   "reason": null || "admin" || "refund" || "insufficient funds"
  //   "order": order (see 'order' event)
  // }]
});

/**
 * Listen for deposit event
 * (happens when a deposit is made)
 */
sideshift.addEventListener("deposit", (deposits) => {
  console.log(deposits);
  // deposits = [{
  //   "depositId": "de6279c2101e211cebbc",
  //   "createdAt": "1555820836956",

  //   "refundAddress": null || "fjdhvbehv543ev4h35bg4u5i34jhcbru3hjfhbj34",
  //   "refundTxid": null || "dfjbd1hjb42hjb5uhj3bh4j2r3b2hjbrt43hj23bruhj3b",
  //   "reason": null || "admin" || "refund" || "insufficient funds"
  //   "order": order (see 'order' event)
  // }]
});

/**
 * Listen for order event
 * (happens when order is supplied to user)
 */
sideshift.addEventListener("order", (order) => {
  console.log(order);
  // order = {
  //     "orderId": "de6279c2101e211cebbc",
  //     "createdAt": "1555820836956",
  //     "depositMethodId": "btc",
  //     "settleMethodId": "bch",
  //     "depositAddress": {
  //       "address": "3Nh4fgyUpdcihZt5f9Ei1QJpREvRDh2TqZ"
  //     },
  //     "depositMax": "1.867",
  //     "depositMin": "0.0001867"
  //   }
  // }
});

### Step 2: Create an HTML File with a Basic Template

Create an index.html file and add the following basic HTML template:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>SideShift Widget Integration Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Add the Embed Code

Go to the [SideShift embed page](https://sideshift.ai/embed). Choose either `Variable Rate` or `Fixed Rate`, fill out the necessary fields, and copy the embed code. Paste this code into the `head` section of your `index.html` file.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>SideShift Widget Integration Demo</title>
    <!-- Add SideShift scripts here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.__SIDESHIFT__ = {
        parentAffiliateId: "k0Kx8oXzy", // Replace with your SideShift.ai account ID
        defaultDepositMethodId: "btc", // Replace with your chosen default deposit method
        defaultSettleMethodId: "eth", // Replace with your chosen default settlement method
        settleAddress: undefined, // Replace with the recipient address if needed
        type: "variable", // Type of shift: variable or fixed
        commissionRate: "0.01", // Optional commission rate (1%)
        settleAmount: undefined, // Replace with the amount to settle if needed
        theme: "dark", // Replace with your chosen theme
      };
    </script>
    <script src="https://sideshift.ai/static/js/main.js"></script>
    <!-- End of SideShift scripts -->
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Add the SideShift Button

Customize the button's label on the embed page and copy the code. Paste it just below the script in your `index.html` file. Add some content to the `body` section and place the button there.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>SideShift Widget Integration Demo</title>
    <!-- Add SideShift scripts here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.__SIDESHIFT__ = {
        parentAffiliateId: "k0Kx8oXzy", // Replace with your SideShift.ai account ID
        defaultDepositMethodId: "btc", // Replace with your chosen default deposit method
        defaultSettleMethodId: "eth", // Replace with your chosen default settlement method
        settleAddress: undefined, // Replace with the recipient address if needed
        type: "variable", // Type of shift: variable or fixed
        commissionRate: "0.01", // Optional commission rate (1%)
        settleAmount: undefined, // Replace with the amount to settle if needed
        theme: "dark", // Replace with your chosen theme
      };
    </script>
    <script src="https://sideshift.ai/static/js/main.js"></script>
    <!-- End of SideShift scripts -->
    <style scoped>
      #sideshift-modal-button {
        -webkit-appearance: none;
        color: rgb(17, 11, 11);
        background-color: rgb(232, 90, 67);
        transition: all 150ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);

        margin: 0 auto;
      }

      #sideshift-modal-button:hover {
        opacity: 0.9;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section>
      <div>

        theme: "dark", // Replace with your chosen theme
      };
    </script>
    <script src="https://sideshift.ai/static/js/main.js"></script>
    <!-- End of SideShift scripts -->
    <style scoped>
      /* Added styles for body and paragraph */
      body {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        font-family: monospace;
        line-height: 150%;

        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        height: 3rem;
        min-width: 13rem;
        border: none;
        cursor: pointer;
        margin: 0 auto;
      }

      #sideshift-modal-button:hover {
        opacity: 0.9;
      }
    </style>

- The script URLs are accessible.

# Widget Integration Guide 2

### Intro

The SideShift widget allows users to seamlessly shift cryptocurrencies directly on your website. This guide covers the steps to integrate the widget using `Option 2: Open Programmatically`, which allows you to open the widget programmatically using a button.

For a video walkthrough, watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJct0OadpH4).

### Step 1: Create a React App

Open the terminal and run the following command to create a new React app using Vite with TypeScript.

```bash
npm create vite@latest sideshift-widget-demo --template react-ts
```

### Step 2: Add the Embed Code

Go to the [SideShift embed page](https://sideshift.ai/embed). Choose either `Variable Rate` or `Fixed Rate`, fill out the necessary fields, and copy the embed code. Paste this code into the `head` section of your `index.html` file.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>SideShift Widget Integration Demo</title>
    <!-- Add SideShift scripts here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.__SIDESHIFT__ = {
        parentAffiliateId: "k0Kx8oXzy", // Replace with your SideShift.ai account ID
        defaultDepositMethodId: "btc", // Replace with your chosen default deposit method
        defaultSettleMethodId: "eth", // Replace with your chosen default settlement method
        settleAddress: undefined, // Replace with the recipient address if needed
        type: "variable", // Type of shift: variable or fixed
        commissionRate: "0.01", // Optional commission rate (1%)
        settleAmount: undefined, // Replace with the amount to settle if needed
        theme: "dark", // Replace with your chosen theme
      };
    </script>
    <script src="https://sideshift.ai/static/js/main.js"></script>
    <!-- End of SideShift scripts -->
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Add the SideShift Button

Create a components folder inside `src` and add a file named `SideShiftButton.tsx`.

```tsx title="src/components/SideShiftButton.tsx"

declare global {
  interface Window {
    sideshift: {
      show: () => void;
      hide: () => void;
    };
  }
}

const SideShiftButton: React.FC = () => {
  const showSideShift = () => {
    if (window.sideshift && window.sideshift.show) {
      window.sideshift.show();
    } else {
      console.error(
        "SideShift script not loaded or sideshift object is not available"
      );
    }
  };

  const handleSettle = (event: CustomEvent) => {
    console.log("Exchange settled:", event.detail);
  };

  const handleDeposit = (event: CustomEvent) => {
    console.log("Deposit made:", event.detail);
  };

  const handleOrder = (event: CustomEvent) => {
    console.log("Order created:", event.detail);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener(
      "sideshift.ai/settle",
      handleSettle as EventListener
    );
    window.addEventListener(
      "sideshift.ai/deposit",
      handleDeposit as EventListener
    );
    window.addEventListener("sideshift.ai/order", handleOrder as EventListener);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener(
        "sideshift.ai/settle",
        handleSettle as EventListener
      );
      window.removeEventListener(
        "sideshift.ai/deposit",
        handleDeposit as EventListener
      );
      window.removeEventListener(
        "sideshift.ai/order",
        handleOrder as EventListener
      );
    };
  }, []);

  return <button onClick={showSideShift}>Shift with SideShift</button>;
};

```

### Step 4: Update App.tsx

Update the `App.tsx` file to include the `SideShiftButton` component.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

```

### Step 5: Apply Custom Styling to the App Container

```css title="src/App.css"
.App {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh; /* Use the full height of the viewport */
}
```

### Step 6: Test locally

Open the terminal and run the following command to test the integration locally.

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see the SideShift widget open when you click the `Shift with SideShift` button.

Your SideShift Widget Integration is now complete.

### See live demo

You can view a demo [here](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/sideshift-ai-widget-guide-2-zjf6tf).

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure:

- Your `parentAffiliateId` is correct.
- You have internet connectivity.
- The script URLs are accessible.
- The SideShiftButton component is correctly importing and rendering.

# Network Fees

- **Sending fee**: This fee is associated with sending the `settleCoin` to your selected wallet address. It applies to BTC, ETH, EVM tokens, TRC20 tokens, ATOM, KAVA, TIA, and SEI.
- **Address fee**: This fee is required for the creation of a unique SideShift.ai deposit address for every Shift. It applies to EVM token deposits. However, currently, contracts are being reused, and no fee is being charged for this.
- **Receiving fee**: This fee is applicable to all ETH, EVM tokens, and TRC20 deposits that require a sweep transaction from the unique deposit address to process the shift.

Please note that these fees are estimated, and the actual fees may vary depending on the network conditions at the time of the transaction.

# Rate Limits

The REST API has rate limits in place to ensure fair usage and protect the system from abuse. Rate limits are enforced per IP address. The following operations have specific rate limits:

- **Creating a Shift:** Clients can create up to 5 shifts per minute. This concerns [`/v2/shifts/fixed`](/endpoints/v2/createfixedshift) and [`/v2/shifts/variable`](/endpoints/v2/createvariableshift) endpoints.
- **Creating a Quote**: Clients can create up to 20 quotes per minute. This concerns the [`/v2/quotes`](/endpoints/v2/requestquote) endpoint.

If a client exceeds these limits, the server will respond with a status code of `429` and a message of `Rate limit exceeded`. Please ensure your application respects these rate limits to avoid disruptions in service.

:::info

If you've created 5 consecutive variable rate shifts, you'll need to wait for one to expire before creating another. Alternatively, you can manually cancel the shifts from the order page or call the [`/v2/cancel-order`](/endpoints/v2/cancelorder) endpoint.

# SideShift Pay Integration Guide

This guide will help you integrate our Stripe-like crypto payment solution into your webshop. Follow the steps below to create checkouts, redirect users for payment, and receive payment notifications via webhooks.

## Introduction

**SideShift Pay** offers a simple and seamless way to accept cryptocurrency payments in your webshop. By integrating our checkout feature, you can allow your customers to pay with any supported cryptocurrency, while you receive settlements in the coin of your choice.

## Prerequisites

- **SideShift.ai Account**: Ensure you have an active SideShift.ai account.
- **Account ID and Private Key**:
  - **Account ID**: Your unique identifier on SideShift.ai. It can also be used as the `affiliateId` to receive commissions.
  - **Private Key**: Your API secret key used for authentication.
  - Both can be acquired from [https://sideshift.ai/account](https://sideshift.ai/account).
- **Affiliate ID**: The Account ID of the account that should receive the commission. It can be your own Account ID or any other Account ID.
- **Web Server**: Your webshop should be able to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Creating a Checkout

To create a new checkout, make a `POST` request to the [`/v2/checkout`](/endpoints/v2/createcheckout) endpoint with the necessary parameters. This will set up the payment details where **you** (the merchant) specify your settlement preferences.

#### Endpoint

```
POST https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/checkout
```

#### Request Headers

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Accept: application/json`
- `x-sideshift-secret: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `x-user-ip: END_USER_IP_ADDRESS` (IP address of the customer initiating the checkout)

#### Request Body Parameters

- `settleCoin` (string, required): The coin **you want to receive** (e.g., `"BTC"`, `"ETH"`).
- `settleNetwork` (string, required): The network of the settle coin (e.g., `"mainnet"`).
- `settleAmount` (string, required): The amount you expect to receive.
- `settleAddress` (string, required): Your wallet address where the settlement will be sent.
- `settleMemo` (string, optional): Required if the coin uses a memo/tag.
- `affiliateId` (string, required): The **Account ID** of the account that should receive the commission. This can be your own Account ID or any other Account ID.
- `successUrl` (string, required): URL to redirect the user after a successful payment.
- `cancelUrl` (string, required): URL to redirect the user if the payment is cancelled.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/checkout' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'x-sideshift-secret: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY' \
  --header 'x-user-ip: END_USER_IP_ADDRESS' \
  --data '{
    "settleCoin": "ETH",
    "settleNetwork": "mainnet",
    "settleAmount": "0.01",
    "settleAddress": "YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS",
    "affiliateId": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID",
    "successUrl": "https://yourwebshop.com/success",
    "cancelUrl": "https://yourwebshop.com/cancel"
  }'
```

#### Successful Response

A successful response will return a JSON object containing the checkout details, including a unique `id` for the checkout.

```json
{
  "id": "uniqueCheckoutID",
  "settleCoin": "ETH",
  "settleNetwork": "mainnet",
  "settleAddress": "YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS",
  "settleAmount": "0.01",
  "updatedAt": "2025-11-05T17:00:13.927000000Z",
  "createdAt": "2025-11-05T17:00:13.927000000Z",
  "affiliateId": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID",
  "successUrl": "https://yourwebshop.com/success",
  "cancelUrl": "https://yourwebshop.com/cancel",
}
```

## Redirecting Users to the Payment Page

After creating the checkout, redirect your customers to the **SideShift Pay** payment page where they can complete the payment. **Customers can choose any of the supported cryptocurrencies to pay with.**

#### Payment URL Format

```
https://pay.sideshift.ai/checkout/{uniqueCheckoutID}
```

Replace `{uniqueCheckoutID}` with the `id` returned from the checkout creation response.

## Setting Up Webhooks

To be notified when a payment is either `success` or `fail`, you need to set up a webhook. SideShift.ai will send a POST request to your specified `targetUrl` whenever there is an update on the checkout.

:::note
Currently, webhooks are set up via a GraphQL mutation. A UI-based setup will be available in the future.
:::

### Creating a Webhook

Make a `POST` request to the GraphQL endpoint to create a webhook.

#### Endpoint

```
POST https://sideshift.ai/graphql
```

#### Request Headers

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `x-sideshift-secret: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`

#### Request Body

Use the following GraphQL mutation to create a webhook:

```json
{
  "query": "mutation { createHook(targetUrl: \"https://yourwebshop.com/api/webhooks/sideshift\") { id createdAt updatedAt targetUrl enabled } }"
}
```

#### Example Request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://sideshift.ai/graphql' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-sideshift-secret: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY' \
  --data '{"query":"mutation { createHook(targetUrl: \"https://yourwebshop.com/api/webhooks/sideshift\") { id createdAt updatedAt targetUrl enabled } }"}'
```

#### Successful Response

The response will include details of the created webhook.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createHook": {
      "id": "uniqueHookID",
      "createdAt": "2025-11-05T17:00:13.927000000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-11-05T17:00:13.927000000Z",
      "targetUrl": "https://yourwebshop.com/api/webhooks/sideshift",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Handling Webhook Notifications

Your server should handle incoming POST requests to the `targetUrl`. The notifications will include details about the checkout and its status.

#### Example Notification Payload

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "hook": {
      "id": "webhookUniqueId",
      "createdAt": "2025-11-05T17:00:13.927000000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-11-05T17:00:13.927000000Z",
      "enabled": true,
      "accountId": "YourAccountId",
      "targetUrl": "YourWebhookUrl"
    }
  },
  "payload": {
    "shiftId": "ShiftId",
    "status": "success",
    "txid": "txHash"
  }
}
```

#### Status Values

- `success`: Payment has been settled
- `fail`: Payment ended unsuccessfully (refunded)

## Sample Code

### Creating a Checkout

```javascript
// Create a checkout session
const response = await fetch('https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/checkout', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'x-sideshift-secret': 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    'x-user-ip': customerIpAddress
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    settleCoin: 'BTC',
    settleNetwork: 'mainnet',
    settleAmount: '0.001',
    settleAddress: 'bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh',
    affiliateId: 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID',
    successUrl: 'https://yourwebshop.com/success',
    cancelUrl: 'https://yourwebshop.com/cancel'
  })
});

const checkout = await response.json();
// Redirect customer to: https://pay.sideshift.ai/checkout/${checkout.id}
```

### Handling Webhook Notifications

```javascript
// Handle webhook notifications
app.post('/webhooks/sideshift', (req, res) => {
  const { meta, payload } = req.body;
  const { shiftId, status, txid } = payload ?? {};

  console.log('Webhook meta:', meta);
  console.log('Webhook payload:', payload);

  switch (status) {
    case 'success':
      console.log(`Shift ${shiftId} succeeded with txid ${txid}`);
      break;
    case 'fail':
      console.log(`Shift ${shiftId} failed`);
      break;
  }

  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

### Checking Order Status

You can use the [`/v2/checkout/{checkoutId}`](/endpoints/v2/checkout) endpoint to fetch the latest checkout data, derive the latest `shiftId` from `checkout.orders`, and then query [`/v2/shifts/{shiftId}`](/endpoints/v2/shift) for the current shift status.

```javascript
// Check latest shift/order status for a checkout
const checkoutResponse = await fetch(`https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/checkout/${checkoutId}`);

const checkout = await checkoutResponse.json();
console.log('Checkout:', checkout);

// Response example
// Checkout: {
//   id: 'fdebd5b5-357a-4cfd-b60b-076ae7c62d77',
//   settleCoin: 'BTC',
//   settleNetwork: 'mainnet',
//   settleAddress: 'bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh',
//   settleAmount: '0.001',
//   updatedAt: '2024-01-01T00:55:33.222000000Z',
//   createdAt: '2024-01-01T00:55:33.222000000Z',
//   affiliateId: 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID',
//   successUrl: 'https://yourwebshop.com/success',
//   cancelUrl: 'https://yourwebshop.com/cancel',
//   orders: [
//     {
//       id: 'd2a473f82603e9ccfbb8',
//       deposits: [
//         {
//           depositHash: '0x73b277e5df00f57a03cbe6ca318ca79e66398a2f3f9ff414966a7ec281e903c8',
//           settleHash: '055f7d293ebd4546b446da0eb920c5c427d72647ae58262e53b8a8a574544dd9'
//         }
//       ]
//     }
//   ]
// }

// The first order in checkout.orders (orders[0]) is the latest shift/order for this checkout
const shiftId = checkout.orders?.[0]?.id;
if (!shiftId) {
  throw new Error('No shiftId found');
}

// Fetch the shift to get the status
const shiftResponse = await fetch(`https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/shifts/${shiftId}`);

const shift = await shiftResponse.json();
console.log('Latest order status:', shift.status);

// Response example
// Latest order status: settled
